- 😄 Pronouns: My pronouns are He/him/his. I identify as a straight guy.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've live most of my life outside of my native country. I speak 4 languages fluently. I forgot my first language, which is Bisaya. The how, and why, this happens is complex and counter-intuitive. I have no idea on how to explain it.
